# Let's create a class that represents a Harry Potter book, using variables and print statements.

class Book:
    title = "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"
    pages = 607
    number = "7th"
    genre = "fantasy"
    print(f"{title} has {pages} pages")
    print(f"It is the {number} in the series.")
